          <h1>How to livestream (for total beginners)</h1>

          <h2>What is a “livestream”?</h2>
          <p>It's a way to broadcast sound or video over the internet. Generally it can be thought of like a digital stage: people see and hear you while you perform.</p>
          <p>You don’t need to livestream to celebrate drone day! Solo drones from home to your cat, or family, or walls are entirely welcome. But we’ll assume that if you keep reading you’d like to try!</p>
          <h2>Tools and equipment needed:</h2>
          <p>You will need a microphone. You may also want a webcam. Many phones and computers have these built in, so if you are aiming for “easy” use these! </p>
          <p>Also consider the space you are performing in. If you are using a camera, does the view capture the magic that you are trying to create? Can you craft a beautiful visual and sonic world? You can surround yourself with all your favourite
            things. You can turn the camera to your face, to your hands, or your lovingly adorned plant.</p>
          <h2>Ways to livestream:</h2>
          <p>First, don’t get overwhelmed! There are a lot of options. But you don’t need to pay attention to all the options, you can choose an option that works well for you and learn as you go.</p>
          <h3>If you have no internet and want to share with someone far away</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>You can use your telephone and call a friend and play for them over the phone line.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>If you are comfortable on social media and want something easy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you use Facebook* on your phone or your computer there is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1636872026560015"> a button to go live.</a></li>
            <li>If you use Instagram* on your phone, there is <a target="_blank" href="https://help.instagram.com/292478487812558"> a button to go live.</a></li>
            <li>If you use Twitter* on your phone, you can use <a target="_blank" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/periscope-broadcast">Periscope</a> to livestream</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most social media options will automatically notify your followers, so (unlike the option below) you aren’t totally reliant on inviting people yourself.</p>
          <h3>If you are comfortable with video meeting software</h3>
          <p>You can use almost any video meeting software to stream. This includes <a target="_blank" href="https://meet.jit.si./">Jitsi</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://zoom.us/meetings">Zoom</a>,<a target="_blank"
